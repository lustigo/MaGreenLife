# MaGreenLife üå≥

> üöÄ This project was realized within 40h as of the [Climathon2019](https://climathon.hackerstolz.de) in Mannheim.

## üéâ Idea

MaGreenLife rewards the user for climate-friendly behavior and gives the city or public transport organisation a possibility to gather data and ideas from their fellow users.

## üèÅ Solution

We have developed a prototype for an application, that rewards the user for climate friendly behavior, via virtual points, achievements or maybe even real-world goodies like low priced public transport tickets. So that the change of the daily routine becomes more easy and makes fun.

We want to bring people together and provide leaderboards, so that they can compete against each other.

We want to support the local economy with self-conscious customers, who are being rewarded for their environmentally-friendly shopping.

And we can also help the local government to get in touch with users to gather new ideas for their important work, so that there is a way from the city to the users and from the users back to the city. Therefore the city and the users can work hand in hand to save our planet.
While rewarding our users for taking more environmentally-friendly transport options, the public transport company can also gather new data by the crowd and increase their customer satisfaction. This is also possible for other local services.

For our prototype we have implemented a leaderboard, the achievement and point collection system, a daily quiz to raise awareness, a Barcode Scanner to track usages of the Mannheim reusable coffe cup at the cash registers and a system to track public transport usages, while concurrently collecting the real-time occupancy of the vehicles.
